## Expression Evaluator

## Overview
The Expression Evaluator is a C++ project designed to parse and calculate arithmetic and logical expressions. This project provides a flexible and extensible framework for evaluating expressions, making it a versatile tool for a wide range of applications.

## Features
Arithmetic Expressions: Evaluate simple and complex arithmetic expressions with support for operators such as +, -, *, /, %, and parentheses.

Logical Expressions: Evaluate logical expressions with operators like AND (&&), OR (||), NOT (!), and parentheses.

Extensible: Easily extend the functionality by adding custom operators and functions, making it suitable for specific domain requirements.

Error Handling: Robust error handling to provide informative feedback on invalid expressions or calculation errors.

Performance: The project is designed to be efficient and optimized for performance, making it suitable for large-scale or real-time applications.

## Getting Started
To use the Expression Evaluator in your project, follow these steps:

## Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/AsifAli78/expression-evaluator.git

Usage
cpp
#include "expression_evaluator.h"

int main() {
    ExpressionEvaluator evaluator;

    // Arithmetic expression
    double result = evaluator.evaluate("2 + 3 * (4 - 1)");

    // Logical expression
    bool isTrue = evaluator.evaluate("true && (false || true)");

    // Custom functions and operators can be added and used as needed.
    
    return 0;
}
